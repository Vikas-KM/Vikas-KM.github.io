	<h2>Projects</h2>
	<h4>Facial Expression Recognition (FER)</h4>
	<p>Implemented FER using tensorflow 2.0 and VGG-16 architecture, the frontend was implemented using opencv for live detection of FER. The source code of the project can be found at the below.<br>

	<h4>Amazon Fine Food Review Sentiment Analysis</h4>
	<p>Sentiment Analysis of the Amazon Fine Food Review was done using Bag of Words and TFIDF. Data Cleaning, Feature Engineering and NLTK was used. The front of the application was done in Flask, where people can write review and get the sentiment of their review using both BoW and TFIDF <br>
